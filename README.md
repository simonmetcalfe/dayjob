# dayjob

##### Make great Spotify playlists while you work.

## How it works
dayjob lets you quickly add and remove songs to your playlists without opening the Spotify app, by using shortcut keys.  It works when music is playing from any source (playlists, radio, artists, albums etc).  It communicates using the Spotify API so it works with the desktop, browser or mobile Spotify app.  dayjob is written in [Node JS Electron](https://electronjs.org/).

In no time you'll have a new playlist with awesome songs!  dayjob currently supports upto 11 different playlists, and can also move or remove songs from the current playlist.

## History
I created this app because I love discovering new tunes while I'm working but don't want to waste time in Spotify.  I've been using a proof of concept with hard coded playlists since 2017 but finally got round to releasing a configurable version that others can use.
